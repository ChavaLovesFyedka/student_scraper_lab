# Sinatra Students

You're going to build a full CRUD application for the Student Website, powered by Sinatra.

It's a complex project and we've provided you with the skeleton of the project.

```

  controllers/
    application_controller.rb
    students_controller.rb
  models/
    student.rb
  views/
    students/
      index.erb
config/
  environment.rb
coverage/
db/

public/
spec/
  controllers/
    students_controller.rb

It's important the before you start the project, each of you read the codebase as it currently stands.
